                      <p>Before you ever sell to a single customer, you'll have to sell your startup to cofounders, investors, and potential employees. We'll discuss the key elements of a great pitch whether it is a one-liner, elevator pitch, or a full slide deck for investors. How do you distill your company into the most important points? What are common pitfalls? And how do you generate a fear of missing out (FOMO)?</p>

                      <p>Sure, your invention is amazing, and your business plan is solid, but before your product ever reaches a patient, you need to get regulatory approval. We'll introduce you to Allison Komiyama, a former FDA reviewer and discuss what it's like dealing with the FDA today (hint: it's not as bad as you think). We'll also cover strategies for getting approval outside the US and how your path might be different depending on whether you're in Health IT, Med Devices, Biotech, or Pharma.</p>
