              <p>Motivated to connect more physician-entrepreneurs, Will founded Enventure, a grass-roots community focused on growing and educating Houston's medical entrepreneur community. Enventure connects young and aspiring entrepreneurs with experienced professionals to accelerate the growth of Houston's medtech startup scene. Enventure's educational programming and one-on-one mentorship launched four life science startups in Houston in 2014.</p>
              <p>Will earned his biomedical engineering degree from USC, where he joined his first medical startup, commercializing a glucose sensor the size of a human hair. After making Houston his home in 2007, Will received his MD from Baylor College of Medicine. Currently, Will is the Director of Clinical Development for Procyrion, developing a miniature heart assist pump implanted without surgery. Will has consulted for many of Houston's seed-stage startups, including MolecularMatch, NanoLinea, Anaxiom, and Nano3D.</p>
