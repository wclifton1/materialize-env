              <p class="medium">BioVentures is a 10 week, hands-on immersion into life science entrepreneurship, where teams of four students begin with nascent intellectual property, conduct market diligence, identify a commercially viable product, and create a commercialization plan, culminating in a refined investor pitch.  Each team will be mentored by experienced medical entrepreneurs. Bioventures gives students practical experience commercializing medical research by reducing complex medical concepts to clear value propositions.</p>

              <h5>Class Format</h5>
              <p>Core lectures consist of a combination of interactive, problem-based “practical” from the faculty and talks from visiting life science entrepreneurs. The project component is a “hands-on” experience where students will work in teams on their respective IP and develop business plans.</p>

              <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
              <p>The course will provide access to pre-screened patents, patent applications, or disclosures related to novel therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices or life science research tools.  Students may develop their business concepts based on these inventions.  The Students will NOT be restricted to working on this pre-vetted intellectual property, but encouraged to conceptualize commercial applications of their own respective research projects.</p>

              <h5>Mentors</h5>
              <p>Each student team will be guided by an experienced life science executive with domain specific knowledge.  You will be assigned a primary mentor, a student mentor and have ad hoc access to secondary mentors.  Remember the role of a mentor is to guide, provide feedback and access to resources.  They are NOT the “CEO” of your business concepts.</p>

He has led the commercialization and development of n3D’s magnetic 3D bioprinting and magnetic levitation technologies. Prior to co-founding n3D, Dr. Souza was an Odyssey Scholar at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. During his work at MD Anderson, he applied a multidisciplinary approach to developing nanotechnology tools for tissue targeted imaging, gene delivery, and tissue engineering.  Towards the end of his Odyssey Scholarship, in collaboration with Drs. Tom Killian and Rob Raphael from Rice University, the genesis of magnetic 3D bioprinting and levitation took place. Now, his mission is to advance the commercialization of magnetic 3D bioprinting and 3D cell culturing into a routine laboratory tool that will measurably improve the drug discovery process, cancer research, and regenerative medicine. Results using n3D’s technologies have been reported in various scientific journals, including Nature, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Protocols, and Nature Reviews Cancer. Recently, Glauco was an invited speaker at TEDx Houston, where he shared his thoughts and experience on resonating aspects between science, levitating cells, friendship, and sports as key ingredients for scientific discovery and the entrepreneurial process. He is also one of the inventors in all six patent applications related to n3D’s technologies and his research has been funded by grants from National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense (DOD), National Institute of Health (NIH), Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), and State of Texas Emerging Technology Fund (TETF). Dr. Souza attended the George Washington University in Washington DC (GWU), where he received B.S. in Chemistry and M.S. and PhD in Physical Chemistry.</p></div>
