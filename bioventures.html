              <h5>Spring</h5>

              <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bioventures-final-pitch-day-tickets-32263496988"><i class="mdi-social-people left"></i>RSVP for Final Pitch Day</a>

              <p class="medium">BioVentures is a 10 week, hands-on immersion into life science entrepreneurship, where teams of four students begin with nascent intellectual property, conduct market diligence, identify a commercially viable product, and create a commercialization plan, culminating in a refined investor pitch.  Each team will be mentored by experienced medical entrepreneurs. Bioventures gives students practical experience commercializing medical research by reducing complex medical concepts to clear value propositions.</p>

              <p>The first two iterations of the course helped launched companies that are still active today. After completing Bioventures in Spring 2014, <a href="http://www.luminostics.com/">Luminostics</a> has gone on to receive grant funding, further develop their prototypes, and recently participated in the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y combinator</a> accelerator program in Summer 2016. In the Bioventures 2015 cohort, the winners, Nangiotex, incorporated their company and have participated in accelerator programs in Boston and New York. Other participants of bioventures are actively involved in the Houston community at companies and institutes including DNAtrix, advanced electrophoresis systems, Cancer Moonshots, and others.</p>

              <h5>Class Format</h5>
              <p>Core lectures consist of a combination of interactive, problem-based “practical” from the faculty and talks from visiting life science entrepreneurs. The project component is a “hands-on” experience where students will work in teams on their respective IP and develop business plans.</p>

              <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
              <p>The course will provide access to pre-screened patents, patent applications, or disclosures related to novel therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices or life science research tools.  Students may develop their business concepts based on these inventions.  The Students will NOT be restricted to working on this pre-vetted intellectual property, but encouraged to conceptualize commercial applications of their own respective research projects.</p>

              <h5>Mentors</h5>
              <p>Each student team will be guided by an experienced life science executive with domain specific knowledge.  You will be assigned a primary mentor, a student mentor and have ad hoc access to secondary mentors.  Remember the role of a mentor is to guide, provide feedback and access to resources.  They are NOT the “CEO” of your business concepts.</p>
